# Hi there, I’m Vishnu Anand 👋

**Business Analyst • ML + AI Enthusiast • Builder**

I like shipping practical ML/GenAI systems end-to-end — from data + modeling to lightweight apps/demos — and turning messy real-world signals into decision-ready insights.

---

## What I’m focused on
- **Applied ML & GenAI**: text classification, evaluation loops, prompt/agent workflows, and turning experiments into reproducible pipelines  
- **Analytics that drives action**: EDA → feature engineering → modeling → clear business takeaways  
- **Product-minded engineering**: prototypes that are demo-able, documented, and easy to iterate on

---

## Featured work (from my pinned repos)
### LLM / NLP + Evaluation
- **[text_classification](https://github.com/Vishnuanand77/text_classification)**  
  Experiments around text classification with structured results folders (model runs, comparisons, and evaluation notebooks).

### Predictive Modeling (Real-world dataset)
- **[airbnb-superhost-prediction](https://github.com/Vishnuanand77/airbnb-superhost-prediction)**  
  End-to-end ML project predicting Superhost status, including EDA, modeling (LogReg, RF, XGBoost, NN), and business insights.

### Sports Analytics / Competition Modeling
- **[Crossroads-Classic-Analytics-Challenge-Learning-Machine](https://github.com/Vishnuanand77/Crossroads-Classic-Analytics-Challenge-Learning-Machine)**  
  Basketball analytics + CatBoost modeling pipeline (EDA + modeling notebooks + submissions workflow).

### Agentic AI (B2B Sales Motion)
- **[pg-sales-agent](https://github.com/Vishnuanand77/pg-sales-agent)**  
  A multi-agent prototype simulating B2B sales workflows (lead research → qualification → meeting booking → quoting) using LangChain + LLMs.

## Tech I work with
**Languages:** Python, SQL, (some) Kotlin / Dart  
**ML / DS:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost/CatBoost, Jupyter  
**GenAI:** LangChain-style orchestration, evaluation-first experimentation  
**Apps / Prototypes:** Flask (lightweight demos), notebooks, small tools  
**Workflow mindset:** clean repos, repeatable runs, clear READMEs, measurable results
